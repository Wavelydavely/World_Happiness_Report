#  Predicting World Happiness
## Overview
The selected topic for the project is predicting world happiness utilizing the world happiness dataset from Kaggle.  This dataset consists of numerous continuous variables presenting the opportunity to utilize a multiple regression machine learning model to predict the happiness of a country or region of the world.  Additionally, using backwards elimination, the variables that are the least predictive of the happiness score can be removed to improve the performance of the model
The source data includes the following:
Country (categorical)
Region of the World (categorical)
Year (categorical)
Happiness Score (continuous)
Economic Production (continuous)
Social Support (continuous)
Life Expectancy (continuous)
Freedom (continuous)
Absence of Corruption (continuous)
Generosity (continuous)

In this project, we are aiming to answer the following questions:
What variables are most predictive of happiness by country?
What variables are most predictive of happiness by region of the world?
Which regionâ€™s happiness has gone up the most? Which has gone down?
