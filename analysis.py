#  Predicting World Happiness
## Overview
The selected topic for the project is predicting world happiness utilizing the world happiness dataset from Kaggle.  This dataset consists of numerous continuous variables presenting the opportunity to utilize a multiple regression machine learning model to predict the happiness of a country or region of the world.  Additionally, using backwards elimination, the variables that are the least predictive of the happiness score can be removed to improve the performance of the model
The source data includes the following:
Country (categorical)
Region of the World (categorical)
Year (categorical)
Happiness Score (continuous)
Economic Production (continuous)
Social Support (continuous)
Life Expectancy (continuous)
Freedom (continuous)
Absence of Corruption (continuous)
Generosity (continuous)

In this project, we are aiming to answer the following questions:
What variables are most predictive of happiness by country?
What variables are most predictive of happiness by region of the world?
Which regionâ€™s happiness has gone up the most? Which has gone down?

## GitHub
Each member of the team has a branch in the World_Happiness_Report where code will be committed before merging with the main branch.  A pull request will be created each time someone from the team wants to work on code from the main branch and any code being merged to the main branch will also be reviewed to avoid conflicts during the process.
Communication with the team will also occur outside of GitHub via slack and video to ensure proper use of GitHub.
