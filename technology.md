# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will be using Pandas to clean the data and perform our analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
We plan on using PostgreSQL for our database storage. This will be used in our machine learning model where each variable and value from our happiness report csv files will be stored in the database. We have a 2021 report and another report with multiple years so we will create two tables and join them to create one table.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard
We will be using Tableau and Stories to display our dashboard with vizualizations and information describing our findings. We believe Tableau will be the most efficient way to vizualize our data.
